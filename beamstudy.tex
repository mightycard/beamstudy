We present here 
%The Mu2e experiment at Fermilab requires the acceleration and transport of intense proton beams, and the delivery of stable and uniform particle spills to the production target. To meet the experimental requirement, particles will be slowly extracted from the Delivery Ring to the external beamline. Using Synergia2, we have performed multi-particle tracking simulations of the third-integer resonant extraction in the Delivery Ring, including space charge effects as well as physical beamline elements and apertures. With a suitable ramp profile of tune-quadrupoles, we modeled a uniform spill structure. In order to minimize beam losses which are critical for efficient extractions, we have implemented a number of features, such as apertures in beamline elements, septum plane alignments. The RF Knockout (RFKO) technique, which excites particles transversely, is employed as a spill regulation system. Combined with a feedback system, it assists in fine-tuning the spill uniformity. Simulation studies have been carried out to optimize the RFKO feedback scheme, which will be helpful in designing the spill regulation system.

\section{\label{sec:bump}Phasespace Corrections with Dynamic Bumps}

In the previous paper~\cite{mu2e}, we discussed that a septum foil plane should be aligned with particles' entrance angles at the septum because of its finite length.
This alignment of the septum foil plane should be optimized in the way to reduce particle losses due to crossing the plane from outside to inside the field region or vice versa.
In the Delivery Ring, however, the septum is placed at a zero dispersion section, and all shrinking separatrices are always centered at origin during an entire extraction period.
These yield that the Hardt condition, a condition to arrange separatrix geometries to superimpose them for different momenta, cannot be fullfiled.
Consequently, particles' angle coordinates at the entrance of the first septum are varying in time.

\begin{figure*}[tbh!]

    \caption{\label{fig:bump0}Phase space plots of particles for 4 different extraction stages: (a) before and (b) after applying dynamic bump corrections}
  \end{center}
\end{figure*}

Fig.~\ref{fig:bump00} shows a phase space of particles for 4 different extraction stages.
The grey shadows are defined as the septum shadow regions in which particles will be lost [ref:M.Pullia].
Streams of unstable particles on the rightmost separatrix branch for each stage are entering the septum field region by crossing the vertical line (color:purple).
As the separatrix is squeezed, these branch arms are moving upward.
The septum foil plane is aligned with an initial extraction stage.
Therefore, the alignment is only valid for a few turns at the beginning, and there will be permanent misalignments of the septum foil plane with respect to $x^{\prime}$'s later.
These result that more particles are entering the septum shadow region (color:grey shadow), and they will be lost.
Variations of angle coordinates at the septum entrance will eventually be seen at the experiment target with large horizontal angular spread of extracted beams.

In order to mitigate these effects, orbit corrections are applied using 4 dynamic angle bumps.
Using 4 dynamic bumps, we could align separatrices to reduce anglular deviations at the septum.
Fig.~\ref{fig:bump1} shows a schematic drawing of 4 dynamic bump locations in the extraction beamline.
2 bumps are located at the upstream of septa, and the other 2 are at the downstream.
Upstream bumps kick particles so that outgoing particles' angles are aligned at the entrance end of the first septum during the entire extraction period.
Then, downstream bumps will kick them back to original orbits.

\end{figure*}

Strengths of local orbit corrections can be easily obtained by applying the transfer matrix method with initial closed orbit conditions.
Using the condition that the closed orbit is zero outside bumps, their strengths, $\theta_{i}$ for $i=1,2,3,4$, are given by
\begin{widetext}
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
  \theta_{1}(t) & = \sqrt{\frac{\beta_{s}}{\beta_{1}}}
               \frac{\sin(\psi_{s} - \psi_{2})}
                    {\sin(\psi_{2} - \psi_{1})}
               \left( - \Delta x_{s}^{\prime} (t) \right),
  \;\;\;
  \theta_{2}(t) = \sqrt{\frac{\beta_{s}}{\beta_{2}}}
               \frac{\sin(\psi_{s} - \psi_{1})}
                    {\sin(\psi_{2} - \psi_{1})}
               \Delta x_{s}^{\prime} (t), \\
  \theta_{3}(t) & = \sqrt{\frac{\beta_{s}}{\beta_{3}}}
               \frac{\sin(\psi_{s} - \psi_{4})}
                    {\sin(\psi_{4} - \psi_{3})}
               \Delta x_{s}^{\prime} (t),
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \theta_{4}(t) = \sqrt{\frac{\beta_{s}}{\beta_{4}}}
               \frac{\sin(\psi_{s} - \psi_{3})}
                    {\sin(\psi_{4} - \psi_{3})}
               \left( - \Delta x_{s}^{\prime} (t) \right),
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{widetext}
where $\beta_{i}$'s are betatron functions at the septum($s$) and bumps($1,2,3,4$), $\psi_{i}$'s are betatron phase advances, and $\Delta x^{\prime}_{s} (t)$ is required changes of angle coordinates at the septum entrance as a function of time.
Fig.~\ref{fig:bump2} shows changes of bump strengths in time.
Since particles' entrance angles to the septum are aligned to the initial extraction stage, bump strengths are zero at the beginning and are maximum at the end of extraction.

  \end{center}
\end{figure*}

Before applying dynamic bumps, phase space of circulating particles are centered at the origin as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:bump0}.
As the separatrix is squeezed by increaing tune-quad strengths, phase space areas are shrinking in time and outgoing branches.
